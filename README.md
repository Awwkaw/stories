# my short stories
This github repository is me trying to learn to write, both in the english and danish tounge.

As such it will hopefully hold a story every day, and with even higher hopes, these stories might improve with time!

At some point I might start posting them to the subreddtit [r/writingprompts](https://www.reddit.com/rwritingprompts)

## the aday.sh script
is a script that sets my folders and files up for writing a short in both languages for a day (so I'll only have files with actual stories)
